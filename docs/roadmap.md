## 1. Vision

*(TODO: Describe the ultimate long-term vision for AetherStack. What impact do we want it to have on software development? E.g., becoming the go-to AI-augmented toolkit for developers, fostering a new level of productivity and code intelligence.)*

## 2. Guiding Principles for Future Development

*(TODO: Reiterate or expand on principles that will guide future choices, e.g., user-centric design, open and extensible architecture, responsible AI, community-driven.)*

## 3. Current Status

*(TODO: Briefly state the current phase of the project, e.g., "Initial boilerplate and documentation complete. Core CLI and Backend under active development.")*
- Foundational mono-repo structure and documentation system established.
- Initial boilerplate code for CLI, Backend, VS Code Extension, and Web Dashboard in place.
- Core components are ready for incremental feature development.

## 4. Short-Term Milestones (Next 3-6 Months)

### 4.1. Milestone 1: Core Functionality & Stability (M1)
*(TODO: Focus on getting the essential features of the CLI and Backend working reliably.)*
- **CLI:** Implement core commands (`init`, `analyze`, `sync`, basic `agent run`).
- **Backend:** Stable API for core operations, basic AI agent orchestration (OpenAI GPT-4), SQLite persistence.
- **AI Agents:** Functional DocGen and AnalyzeAgent (initial versions).
- **Testing:** Robust unit and integration tests for CLI and Backend core features.
- **Documentation:** User guides for initial CLI commands and Backend API usage.

### 4.2. Milestone 2: Enhanced AI Agent Capabilities (M2)
*(TODO: Expand the capabilities and number of AI agents.)*
- **AI Agents:** Refine DocGen and AnalyzeAgent. Implement initial versions of TestGen and SyncAgent.
- **Backend:** Improved agent management, basic LangChain stubs for future agent development.
- **CLI:** More sophisticated agent interaction commands.
- **VS Code Extension:** Basic integration with Backend for triggering agents and displaying results.

### 4.3. Milestone 3: VS Code Extension Polish & Web Dashboard Alpha (M3)
*(TODO: Improve the VS Code extension usability and release an early version of the Web Dashboard.)*
- **VS Code Extension:** Key features implemented (control panel, AI code assistance stubs, repo insights view).
- **Web Dashboard:** Alpha release with basic repository status visualization and AI agent report viewing (read-only).
- **Backend:** API endpoints to support dashboard data requirements.
- **CI/CD:** Automated build and test pipelines fully operational for all components.

## 5. Medium-Term Goals (6-12 Months)

### 5.1. Advanced AI Integrations (LangChain, Local Models)
*(TODO: Deeper integration with LangChain for complex agent behaviors. Support for Hugging Face Transformers or other local models.)*

### 5.2. Expanded GitHub Integration
*(TODO: More comprehensive GitHub interactions, e.g., issue tracking, PR management, webhook handling for real-time updates.)*

### 5.3. Community Building & Plugin Ecosystem
*(TODO: Efforts to grow a user and contributor community. Develop an SDK or clear guidelines for creating third-party agents or plugins.)*

### 5.4. Web Dashboard Beta & User Accounts
*(TODO: More feature-rich Web Dashboard. Potential for user accounts to personalize experience and manage settings if applicable.)*

## 6. Long-Term Vision (12+ Months)

### 6.1. Multi-User and Team Collaboration Features
*(TODO: If AetherStack evolves to support teams, features for shared configurations, collaborative AI workflows, and project-level insights for teams.)*

### 6.2. Multi-Agent Workflows
*(TODO: Ability to define and execute complex workflows involving multiple AI agents working in concert to achieve a larger goal.)*

### 6.3. Broader IDE Support (Beyond VS Code)
*(TODO: Explore possibilities for plugins or integrations with other popular IDEs like JetBrains suite, Sublime Text, etc.)*

### 6.4. Enterprise Features (Future Consideration)
*(TODO: Potential for features tailored to enterprise needs, e.g., on-premise deployment, advanced security and compliance, role-based access control.)*

## 7. Key Feature Areas for Future Development

*(TODO: A more granular list of desired features and improvements within each component.)*

### 7.1. AI Agents
- New agent types (e.g., security vulnerability detection, refactoring assistant, performance profiler).
- More sophisticated prompt engineering and context management.
- User customization of agent behavior.

### 7.2. CLI Enhancements
- Interactive modes for commands.
- Improved output formatting and verbosity controls.
- Shell completion scripts.

### 7.3. Backend API
- GraphQL support alongside REST.
- Real-time communication (WebSockets) for agent status updates.
- Advanced caching strategies.

### 7.4. VS Code Extension
- Deeper integration with VS Code√≠s language features.
- More interactive UI elements and visualizations.
- Customizable keybindings and settings.

### 7.5. Web Dashboard
- Interactive charts and data exploration tools.
- Customizable dashboards.
- User authentication and authorization.

### 7.6. Performance and Scalability
- Optimizing AI agent execution times.
- Scaling backend services to handle more users/requests.
- Efficient data handling for large repositories.

### 7.7. Security
- Regular security audits.
- Enhanced protection for API keys and sensitive data.
- Secure communication between all components.

## 8. Open Tasks & Known Enhancements

*(TODO: This section will be populated with specific tasks and enhancement ideas as they arise. Link to GitHub Issues for tracking.)*
- Example: `[#123] Improve error handling in CLI sync command`
- Example: `[#124] Add support for custom prompts in DocGen agent`
