## 1. Testing Philosophy

*(TODO: Describe the core principles guiding the testing strategy, e.g., test pyramid, early bug detection, confidence in releases, automation first.)*
- Aim for high test coverage for critical components.
- Tests should be reliable, fast, and easy to maintain.

## 2. Types of Tests

### 2.1. Unit Tests
*(TODO: Focus on testing individual functions, methods, or classes in isolation. Mock dependencies.)*

### 2.2. Integration Tests
*(TODO: Focus on testing interactions between modules or components, e.g., CLI to Backend, Backend to Database, Backend to GitHub API.)*

### 2.3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Future)
*(TODO: Testing complete user flows across multiple components, simulating real user scenarios. Mention tools like Cypress or Playwright for UI testing.)*

### 2.4. AI Agent Specific Tests
*(TODO: Unique challenges in testing AI components, focus on input/output contracts, behavior with mocked AI responses.)*

## 3. Testing by Component

### 3.1. CLI (Go + Cobra)
Located in `cli/tests/`.

#### 3.1.1. Unit Testing Tools (Go test)
*(TODO: Utilize Goís built-in `test` package. Focus on testing individual commands and helper functions. Use table-driven tests where appropriate.)*
- Example: `go test ./...`

#### 3.1.2. Integration Testing Approach
*(TODO: Test CLI commands by executing the compiled binary and asserting output or side effects. May involve a running instance of the backend API for some tests.)*

### 3.2. Backend API Server (Python + FastAPI)
Located in `backend/tests/`.

#### 3.2.1. Unit Testing Tools (Pytest)
*(TODO: Use Pytest for its rich feature set and plugin ecosystem. Test individual service functions, utility classes, and Pydantic models.)*
- Example: `pytest`

#### 3.2.2. Integration Testing (Pytest + HTTPX/TestClient)
*(TODO: Use FastAPIís `TestClient` (based on HTTPX) to make requests to API endpoints and assert responses. Test API contracts, request/response validation, and business logic flow.)*

#### 3.2.3. Database Testing
*(TODO: Strategies for testing database interactions. Use a separate test database (e.g., in-memory SQLite or a dedicated PostgreSQL test instance). Ensure data isolation between tests. Test ORM models and queries.)*

### 3.3. VS Code Extension (TypeScript)
Located in `vscode-extension/src/test/` (or similar, depending on convention).

#### 3.3.1. Unit Testing Tools (Jest/Mocha)
*(TODO: Use Jest or Mocha for unit testing TypeScript code. Mock VS Code API dependencies where necessary.)*
- Example: `npm test` or `yarn test` configured to run Jest/Mocha.

#### 3.3.2. Integration Testing (VS Code Test API)
*(TODO: Utilize `@vscode/test-electron` or similar tools to run tests within an instance of VS Code. Test command registrations, UI interactions (e.g., opening webviews), and interactions with the actual VS Code API.)*

### 3.4. Web Dashboard (Next.js + TailwindCSS)
Located in `dashboard/tests/` (or similar).

#### 3.4.1. Unit Testing Tools (Jest + React Testing Library)
*(TODO: Use Jest and React Testing Library for testing individual React components and utility functions. Focus on behavior rather than implementation details.)*
- Example: `npm test` or `yarn test`.

#### 3.4.2. Component Testing
*(TODO: Testing components in isolation, verifying their rendering and interactions.)*

#### 3.4.3. E2E Testing (Cypress/Playwright - Future)
*(TODO: Plans for using Cypress or Playwright to test user flows within the web dashboard.)*

## 4. AI Agent Testing

Testing AI agents requires specific strategies due to their non-deterministic nature and reliance on external models.

### 4.1. Mocking External AI Services
*(TODO: For unit and integration tests, mock responses from OpenAI API or other AI services to ensure deterministic and fast tests. Focus on testing the agentís logic around the AI call.)*

### 4.2. Input/Output Validation
*(TODO: Validate the structure and content of inputs passed to AI models and the outputs received. Ensure agents handle various AI responses gracefully, including errors or unexpected formats.)*

### 4.3. Scenario-Based Testing
*(TODO: Define a set of representative scenarios with expected inputs and (potentially broad) expected outputs or behaviors. This might involve some level of qualitative assessment for generative tasks.)*

## 5. Continuous Integration (CI) Overview

CI is crucial for maintaining code quality and ensuring that changes do not break existing functionality.

### 5.1. GitHub Actions
*(TODO: AetherStack will use GitHub Actions for CI. Placeholder workflows will be located in `.github/workflows/`.)*
- `lint.yml`: For running linters across all relevant codebases.
- `test.yml`: For running unit and integration tests.
- `docs-deploy.yml`: For building and deploying documentation (e.g., to GitHub Pages).

### 5.2. Workflow Triggers
*(TODO: Workflows will be triggered on pushes to main/development branches and on pull requests.)*

### 5.3. Key CI Steps

#### 5.3.1. Linting
*(TODO: Run linters for Go, Python, TypeScript to enforce code style and catch common errors.)*

#### 5.3.2. Unit Tests Execution
*(TODO: Execute unit tests for all components.)*

#### 5.3.3. Integration Tests Execution
*(TODO: Execute integration tests, potentially requiring setup of services like a test database.)*

#### 5.3.4. Build Verification
*(TODO: Ensure all components can be built successfully.)*

#### 5.3.5. Code Coverage Reports (Future)
*(TODO: Plans to integrate tools like Codecov or Coveralls to track test coverage.)*

## 6. Test Data Management

*(TODO: Strategies for managing test data, especially for integration and E2E tests. Use fixtures, factories, or small, representative datasets. Avoid sensitive data in test suites.)*

## 7. Writing Good Tests

*(TODO: Brief guidelines for writing effective tests: clear, concise, independent, maintainable. Follow Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern.)*

## 8. Test Execution and Reporting

*(TODO: How tests are run locally by developers and how results are reported in CI. Integration with PR checks.)*

*A robust testing strategy is key to the success of AetherStack. This document will be updated as the testing infrastructure and practices mature.*
