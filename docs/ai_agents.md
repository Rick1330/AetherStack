- Examples: Agents that can use external tools, maintain conversational memory, or follow complex reasoning chains.

### 2.3. Hugging Face Transformers Support
*(TODO: Plans for integrating open-source models from Hugging Face for specific tasks or for users who prefer local/self-hosted models. How these models might be loaded and used.)*
- Support for running local, specialized models for tasks like code summarization, translation, or specific types of analysis.

### 2.4. Local and Modular Agents
*(TODO: Architecture for supporting agents that run locally (e.g., smaller models, rule-based systems) and a modular design for easily adding new agents.)*

### 2.5. Future Integrations (Anthropic, Groq, etc.)
*(TODO: Acknowledge the evolving AI landscape and AetherStackís aim to be adaptable to new models and platforms.)*

## 3. Agent Orchestration
