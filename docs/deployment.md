## 1. Deployment Philosophy

*(TODO: Outline the goals for deployment, e.g., ease of setup, scalability, reliability, automation. Mention different deployment targets for different components.)*

## 2. Prerequisites for Deployment

*(TODO: List any accounts or tools needed before starting deployment, e.g., Docker Hub account, cloud provider accounts, `vsce` CLI.)*

## 3. Deploying the Backend API Server (Python + FastAPI)

### 3.1. Containerization (Docker)
Containerizing the backend with Docker is highly recommended for consistency and portability.

#### 3.1.1. Dockerfile for Backend
*(TODO: Provide a sample `Dockerfile` for the FastAPI backend. It should include Python setup, dependency installation, and command to run Uvicorn/Gunicorn.)*
```dockerfile
# TODO: Placeholder Dockerfile for FastAPI backend
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY ./requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /app/requirements.txt

COPY ./src /app/src

# EXPOSE 8000 # Port used by Uvicorn/Gunicorn
# CMD ["uvicorn", "src.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

#### 3.1.2. Building and Running Docker Image
*(TODO: Commands to build and run the Docker image locally for testing.)*
```bash
# docker build -t aetherstack-backend .
# docker run -p 8000:8000 aetherstack-backend
```

### 3.2. Deployment to Cloud Platforms (e.g., Vercel, Heroku, AWS, GCP, Azure)

#### 3.2.1. Vercel (Serverless Functions)
*(TODO: How to deploy FastAPI on Vercel, potentially by wrapping it as a serverless function. Vercel is more common for Next.js but can host Python.)*

#### 3.2.2. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) Options (Heroku, Google App Engine)
*(TODO: General guidance for deploying to PaaS providers. Usually involves pushing code and configuring Procfile or similar.)*

#### 3.2.3. Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS)
*(TODO: For more complex deployments, an overview of deploying to Kubernetes. Mention creating Deployments, Services, and managing configurations with ConfigMaps/Secrets.)*

### 3.3. Configuration Management (Environment Variables)
*(TODO: Emphasize using environment variables for all configurations (database URLs, API keys, etc.) to follow 12-factor app principles.)*

### 3.4. Database Deployment (PostgreSQL)
*(TODO: Options for deploying PostgreSQL (e.g., managed services like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Heroku Postgres, or self-hosting).)*

## 4. Publishing the VS Code Extension

### 4.1. Packaging the Extension (`vsce` tool)
*(TODO: Install and use `vsce` (Visual Studio Code Extensions) CLI tool to package the extension into a `.vsix` file.)*
```bash
# npm install -g vsce
# cd vscode-extension
# vsce package
```

### 4.2. Publishing to Visual Studio Marketplace
*(TODO: Steps to create a publisher account on Azure DevOps and publish the `.vsix` file to the Marketplace using `vsce publish`.)*

### 4.3. Private Extension Hosting (Future)
*(TODO: Mention possibilities for hosting extensions privately if needed.)*

## 5. Hosting the Web Dashboard (Next.js + TailwindCSS)

### 5.1. Static Site Generation (SSG) or Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
*(TODO: Discuss implications of choosing SSG vs SSR for Next.js deployment.)*

### 5.2. Hosting Options

#### 5.2.1. Vercel (Recommended for Next.js)
*(TODO: Vercel is the creator of Next.js and offers seamless deployment. Connect GitHub repo and Vercel handles the rest.)*

#### 5.2.2. Netlify
*(TODO: Another popular option for hosting modern web applications.)*

#### 5.2.3. GitHub Pages (for fully static exports)
*(TODO: If the dashboard can be fully exported as static HTML/CSS/JS using `next export`, it can be hosted on GitHub Pages.)*

#### 5.2.4. Self-hosting with Node.js Server
*(TODO: Running `next start` on a server with Node.js installed.)*

## 6. CI/CD Pipelines for Deployment

Automated deployment using CI/CD pipelines is crucial for efficient and reliable releases.

### 6.1. GitHub Actions for Automated Deployments
*(TODO: Placeholder GitHub Actions workflow files will be in `.github/workflows/`. These will be expanded.)*

#### 6.1.1. Backend Deployment Workflow
*(TODO: Trigger on pushes/tags to main branch. Steps: build Docker image, push to registry (e.g., Docker Hub, ECR, GCR), deploy to target platform.)*

#### 6.1.2. VS Code Extension Publishing Workflow
*(TODO: Trigger on new tags. Steps: install `vsce`, package, publish to Marketplace using a PAT.)*

#### 6.1.3. Web Dashboard Deployment Workflow
*(TODO: Trigger on pushes/tags to main branch. Steps: build Next.js app, deploy to Vercel/Netlify or other hosting.)*

#### 6.1.4. Documentation Deployment (MkDocs to GitHub Pages)
*(TODO: Workflow to build MkDocs site and deploy it to the `gh-pages` branch for hosting on GitHub Pages. A placeholder `docs-deploy.yml` will be provided.)*

### 6.2. Managing Secrets and Credentials
*(TODO: Use GitHub Actions Secrets for storing API keys, tokens, and other sensitive information needed during deployment.)*

## 7. Monitoring and Logging

*(TODO: Briefly mention the importance of setting up monitoring and logging for deployed applications to track health, performance, and errors. Tools like Sentry, Datadog, Prometheus/Grafana, or cloud provider specific tools.)*

## 8. Scaling Considerations

*(TODO: High-level thoughts on scaling different components, e.g., stateless backend for horizontal scaling, database read replicas, CDN for frontend assets.)*

*This deployment guide will be refined as AetherStack matures and specific deployment targets are chosen.*
