# AetherStack â€“ AI-Augmented Repository Management System

## Project Overview

AetherStack is a powerful, multi-interface developer toolkit designed to streamline repository management, integrate AI-powered workflows and agents, automate GitHub project handling, and provide intuitive interfaces through a Command Line Interface (CLI), a VS Code extension, and a web dashboard. This system aims to enhance developer productivity by automating routine tasks and providing intelligent insights into software projects.

## Feature Summary

- **CLI Tool:** Manage local repositories, run AI agents, sync with GitHub, generate documentation and tests directly from your terminal.
- **Backend API Server:** Orchestrates AI workflows, interacts with GitHub APIs, manages agent operations, and handles data processing.
- **VS Code Extension:** Provides a GUI-based control panel within VS Code for executing CLI/backend actions, offering code analysis, summaries, and more.
- **Web Dashboard (Optional):** A standalone user interface for visualizing repository status, AI agent reports, and AI-generated insights.
- **AI-Powered Automation:** Includes features like automatic documentation generation, intelligent code synchronization, AI-assisted test case creation, and in-depth repository analysis.

## Setup Instructions

Detailed setup instructions for each component (CLI, Backend, VS Code Extension, Web Dashboard) can be found in the `/docs/development_guide.md` file.

Generally, you will need to have Go, Python, Node.js, and npm/yarn installed. Each module will have its own specific setup steps.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/aetherstack.git
cd aetherstack

# Setup instructions for each component are in their respective READMEs and the development guide.
# For example, for the CLI:
# cd cli
# go mod tidy
# go build

# For the backend:
# cd backend
# pip install -r requirements.txt (or use poetry/pdm)
# uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

## Demo Use Cases

*(This section will be updated with concrete examples and walkthroughs as development progresses.)*

1.  **Initialize a new project with AetherStack:**
    ```bash
    aether init --repo-url <your-git-repo-url>
    ```
2.  **Analyze a repository for code quality and generate a summary:**
    ```bash
    aether analyze --path /path/to/your/repo
    ```
3.  **Generate documentation for a specific module:**
    ```bash
    aether docs generate --module <module-name>
    ```
4.  **Use the VS Code extension to get AI-powered code suggestions.**
5.  **View project health and AI insights on the Web Dashboard.**
